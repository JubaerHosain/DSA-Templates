I want to know that can we apply Dijkstra algorithm for multiple sources?
If we give all sources to current shortest path to zero and insert all sources 
to the queue and then regular relaxation.
Is this above approach work? Can anyone help me out?

:) Yes,
For simplicity. Create a dummy node ‘x’ and connect ‘x’ to your sources.
Now, apply dijkstra as x as source.
