Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm 
The following is simple idea of Ford-Fulkerson algorithm:
1) Start with initial flow as 0.
2) While there is a augmenting path from source to sink. 
           Add this path-flow to flow.
3) Return flow.

Time Complexity: Time complexity of the above algorithm is O(max_flow * E). We run a 
loop while there is an augmenting path. In worst case, we may add 1 unit flow in every iteration. 
Therefore the time complexity becomes O(max_flow * E).
