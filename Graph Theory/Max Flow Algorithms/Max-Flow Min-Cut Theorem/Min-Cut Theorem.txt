In computer science and optimization theory, the max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, 
the maximum amount of flow(max-flow) passing from the source to the sink is equal to the total weight of 
the edges in a minimum cut.
i.e.minimum cut: the smallest total weight of the edges which if removed would disconnect the source from the sink.

Following are steps to print all edges of the minimum cut.
1) Run Ford-Fulkerson/Edmond-Karp algorithm and consider the final residual graph.
2) Find the set of vertices that are reachable from the source in the residual graph.
3) All edges which are from a reachable vertex to non-reachable vertex are minimum cut edges. Print all such edges.
