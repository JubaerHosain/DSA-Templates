Segment tree can be used to do preprocessing and query in moderate time. With segment tree, preprocessing time is O(n) and time to for GCD/SUM/MIN/MAX query 
is O(Logn). The extra space required is O(n) to store the segment tree.

Representation of Segment trees:
1. Leaf Nodes are the elements of the input array.
2. Each internal node represents GCD of all leaves under it.
3. Array representation of tree is used to represent Segment Trees i.e., for each node at index i,

for 0 indexing
Left child is at index 2*i+1
Right child at 2*i+2 and the parent is at floor((i-1)/2).

for 1 indexing
left child 2*i;
right child 2*i+1
