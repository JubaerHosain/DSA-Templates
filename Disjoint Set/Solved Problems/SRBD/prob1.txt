Samsung wants to build a new R&D center in Bangladesh with N employees. The employees are numbered from 0 to N - 1. Now Samsung hires N employees. Given a 0-indexed integer array hires which contains employee IDs sorted in decreasing order of their seniority level and all the employee IDs will be distinct.

Now Samsung wants to implement 3 types of changes to run the R&D center successfully. Can you handle Q queries of the following types and help Samsung to build the new R&D center and their system?

Type 1: There will be 2 employee IDs A & B - meaning A & B form a team. If A or B belong to any team then these 2 teams will form a new team or they already belong to the same team then you don't have to form any team because they already belong in the same team.
Type 2: Given an employee ID X, employee X has been promoted to the next level.
Type 3: Now given an employee ID Y, you have to check who is the most senior employee in Y employee's team and return his employee ID. If there are multiple same level employees in the team then the employee with greater employee ID will be preferred.
Input Format

In the first line you're given N and Q. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the hires array. Then next Q lines each will contain any of the given 3 types of changes.

Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= hires[i] <= N - 1
1 <= Q <= 10^5
0 <= A, B, X, Y <= N - 1
Output Format

Answer the type 3 query and each answer will be seperated by a new line.
