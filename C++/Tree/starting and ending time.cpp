Initially, T equals zero. Now we have a beautiful structure giving us so much information about the tree. 
Consider all segments [tinv;toutv]. We can see that is no pair of intersecting segments. 
The pair of segments [tinv;toutv] and [tinu;toutu] is either non-intersecting at all or one segment lies inside the other one.
The second beautiful fact is that for each vertex u in the subtree of v the segment [tinu;toutu] lies inside the segment [tinv;toutv].
