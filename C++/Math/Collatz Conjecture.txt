Given a positive integer n, the task is to find whether this number reaches to 1 after performing following two operations:- 
 
If n is even, then n = n/2.
If n is odd, then n = 3*n + 1.
Repeat above steps, until it becomes 1.

// now Collatz Conjecture says that the steps must end in 1 after a finite number of steps...
