The primitive root of a prime number n is an integer r between[1, n-1] such that the values of r^x(mod n) where x is in the range[0, n-2] are different. Return -1 if n is a non-prime number.

An efficient solution is based on the below facts. 
If the multiplicative order of a number r modulo n is equal to Euler Totient Function Î¦(n) ( note that the Euler Totient Function for a prime n is n-1), then it is a primitive root.
