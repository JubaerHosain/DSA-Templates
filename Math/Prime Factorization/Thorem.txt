Since n is composite, so it has a factor a with1<a<n.

Then by the definition of a factor of positive integers, we have

n=abwhere b is a positive integer>1(1)

We need to show thata≤n−−√orb≤n−−√

Ifa>n−−√andb>n−−√thenab>n−−√×n−−√=n

which is a contradiction to (1)

Consequently,a≤n−−√orb≤n−−√

Since both a and b are divisors of n, we see that n has a positive divisor

not exceedingn−−√.

This divisor is either prime or, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic,

has a prime divisor less than itself. In either case, n has a prime 

divisor≤n−−√.This completes the proof.
