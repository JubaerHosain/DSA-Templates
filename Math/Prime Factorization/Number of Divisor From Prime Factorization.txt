Let d(n) be the number of divisors for the natural number, n.

We begin by writing the number as a product of prime factors: n = p^a * q^b * r^c... then the number of divisors, d(n)=(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)...
To prove this, we first consider numbers of the form, n=pa. The divisors are 1,p,p2,...,pa; that is, d(pa)=a+1.

Now consider n=paqb. The divisors would be:

1,p,p2,...,pa,
q,pq,p2q,...,paq,

q2,pq2,p2q2,...,paq2,
...,...,...,...,...,

qb,pqb,p2qb,...,paqb
Hence we prove that the function, d(n), is multiplicative, and in this particular case, d(paqb)=(a+1)(b+1). It should be clear how this can be extended for any 
natural number which is written as a product of prime factors.
