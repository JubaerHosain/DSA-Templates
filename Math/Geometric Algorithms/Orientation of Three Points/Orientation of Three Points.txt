Slope of line segment (p1, p2): σ = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)
Slope of line segment (p2, p3): τ = (y3 - y2)/(x3 - x2)

If  σ > τ, the orientation is clockwise (right turn)

Using above values of σ and τ, we can conclude that, 
the orientation depends on sign of  below expression: 

(y2 - y1)*(x3 - x2) - (y3 - y2)*(x2 - x1)

Above expression is negative when σ < τ, i.e.,  counterclockwise
