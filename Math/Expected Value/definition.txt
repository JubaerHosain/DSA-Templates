Expectation or expected value of any group of numbers in probability is the long-run average 
value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. For example, the expected value in rolling 
a six-sided die is 3.5, because the average of all the numbers that come up in an extremely large 
number of rolls is close to 3.5. Less roughly, the law of large numbers states that the arithmetic 
mean of the values almost surely converges to the expected value as the number of repetitions 
approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, EV, or first moment.
