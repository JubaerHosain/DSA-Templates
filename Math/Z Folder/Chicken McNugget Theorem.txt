The Chicken McNugget Theorem (or Postage Stamp Problem or Frobenius Coin Problem) states that for any two relatively prime positive integers 
(m, n), the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form of (am + bn) for nonnegative integers (a, b) is (mn-m-n).

The numbers greater than mn-m-n can be represented as a non-negative linear combination of m, n. 

NOTE: m, n are co-prime.
